The Tools for Simulating Orbiting Planets in Python

you’ll use arbitrary units for this simulation. This means that you’ll use values without any specific unit for the mass and distance. The numbers used for distance will represent the distance in pixels. 

you’ll use the turtle module to deal with the graphics.

You’ll also use classes and object-oriented programming to create the solar system and the bodies within it.
